    <h1 class="header"> Top 3 bottled waters ranked by Evan </h1>
    <p id="intro-text">Bottled waters from different sources have different health benefits and tastes. Unfortunately,
        I've only tried a limited
        number of bottled water brands in my lifetime so far but here's a review of the ones I have
        tried. </p>

    <h2 id="ranking-header">Ranking of Bottled Waters I've tried</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Fiji</li>
        <li>Evian</li>
        <li>Poland Spring</li>
        <li>Dasani</li>
        <li>Aquafina</li>
        <li>Nestle Pure Life</li>
    </ol>

        <h2 class="blog-box-h2">Fiji Water</h2>
        <img src="fijiWater.jpg" alt="Image of Fiji Water">
        <p>Here's my favorite bottled water brand. It costed me $3 but as a self-proclaimed water connoisseur, I think
            it was worth it. Compared to all the other bottled water brands I've tried, it tastes the best and it also
            has the best
            mineral contents. It has magnesium, calcium, potassium, silica, sodium, bicarbonate, and other healthy
            minerals and also tastes better than the rest of the bottled waters so it gets ranked first. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-box-h2">Evian Water</h2>
        <img src="evianWater.jpg" alt="Image of Evian Water">
        <p>Evian water gets ranked second because although it also has a lot of healthy minerals, (calcium, magnesium,
            potassium, silica
            bicarbonates, sulfates, and chlorides) it's quite hard to drink evian water because of the high mineral
            content.
            Drinking evian water feels like drinking salt water and it even has a milky texture because of the high
            amounts of calcium in it. It's
            still a pretty good option if you need to replenish your minerals. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-box-h2">Poland Spring</h2>
        <img src="polandSpringWater.jpg" alt="Image of Poland Spring Water">
        <p>Poland Spring is the classic go to option that's affordable and keeps you hydrated, but it doesn't have
            as many minerals
            as Evian or Fiji water does. Nonetheless, it still does its job and tastes ok. </p>
